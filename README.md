# AI-Powered Maritime Route Optimization with Risk Assessment and Iceberg Avoidance

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Maritime Route Optimization with Risk Assessment and Iceberg Avoidance** system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance Arctic navigation. The system optimizes maritime routes while considering iceberg locations, weather conditions, and oceanographic risks to ensure safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible shipping in the Arctic. The platform integrates predictive models, real-time hazard detection, and dynamic rerouting to improve Arctic shipping logistics.

The core technologies include **TensorFlow.js**, **Random Forest algorithms**, **K-Means clustering**, and **OpenLayers** for real-time data visualization. This project is intended to serve as a foundation for scalable and intelligent maritime navigation solutions, particularly in polar regions, with potential for global maritime applications.

## Key Features
- **Optimized Route Generation**: Generates safe sea-only routes between Arctic ports considering various environmental factors.
- **Hazard Alerts**: Provides real-time notifications for risks such as icebergs, storms, and shallow waters.
- **Dynamic Rerouting**: Automatically recalculates the route when new hazards are detected.
- **Risk Visualization**: Displays traffic data, iceberg density, and risk zones using interactive visualizations.
- **Real-time Risk Detection**: Classifies environmental and iceberg risks using machine learning models.
- **Port Traffic Monitoring**: Analyzes port traffic and clusters using K-Means clustering to identify optimal routing strategies.

### How to Create the `requirements.txt`:
For **backend**:

1. Install all necessary Python libraries as per the `requirements.txt` file using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. If you need to generate `requirements.txt` based on your current Python environment, you can run:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

For **frontend**:

1. Initialize your React app with TypeScript by running the following:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app maritime-navigation-app --template typescript
    ```

2. Install the necessary frontend libraries:
    ```bash
    npm install react react-dom react-scripts tailwindcss openlayers lucide-react zustand recharts
    ```

3. To build the React app, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
